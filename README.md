## What's a "game launcher"?

Nostlan isn't just a fancy file browser for your game files, it brings the console gaming experience to your computer!

### Total emulation noob?

With Nostlan you can install new emulators with a single click. It's never been easier to get started with emulation!

### Hardcore collector?

A big bookshelf of game boxes is an impressive feat. A list of games displayed by a file explorer? Pretty lame.

With Nostlan you can show off your digital collection with high quality box art. Nostlan is unlike any other launcher thanks to its minimal, [skeuomorphic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeuomorph) UI design. It's like a virtual game room!

Check out the screenshots below. üëá

### Couch gamer?

Nostlan was designed to be used with a game controller, so you won't have to use a mouse and keyboard if you don't want to. Nostlan's UI uses large text only, making it perfect for a big UHD TV or projector.

## Is Nostlan safe to use?

Allow me to introduce myself, my full legal name is Quinton Michael Ashley.

I created Nostlan for fun and also to learn more about app development. Since Nostlan started as a personal project I wasn't under any pressure to make it look like a corporate website or follow any UI standards. Nostlan is an experiment in UI design. I consider it a piece of art that I'm sharing because I want other people to experience it too. Of course, I'd also like making some money off it but I have no interest in collecting your usage data, hijacking your cpu to mine crypto sh\*tcoin, or doing anything malicious.

I also put a LOT of effort into following the latest Electron security standards. All the 3rd party emulator cores that Nostlan uses are sandboxed, meaning they run in isolation from the main process.

## Legal Info

Nostlan was designed to enhance the experience of managing and playing legally obtained video games through compatible emulators. It is developed and distributed as an independent software project and is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by any console manufacturer or game publisher.

‚ÄãU.S. courts have consistently held that emulator software is legal when developed independently without copying proprietary source code. Downloading or sharing games you do not own is illegal.‚Äã‚Äã
