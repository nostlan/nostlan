## What's a "game launcher"?

Nostlan isn't just a fancy file browser for your game files, it brings the console gaming experience to your computer!

### Total emulation noob?

With Nostlan you can install new emulators with a single click. It's never been easier to get started with emulation!

### Hardcore collector?

A big bookshelf of game boxes is an impressive feat. A list of games displayed by a file explorer? Pretty lame.

Use Nostlan to show off your virtual game collection with high quality box assets. Nostlan is [unlike any other game launcher](https://github.com/nostlan/nostlan/wiki/UI-Design) because it has a minimal, [skeuomorphic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeuomorph) UI design that prioritizes box art. It's like a virtual game room!

Check out the screenshots below. üëá

### Couch gamer?

Nostlan was designed to be used with a game controller, so you won't have to use a mouse and keyboard if you don't want to. Nostlan's UI uses large text only, making it perfect for a big UHD TV or projector.

## Is Nostlan safe to use?

Allow me to introduce myself, my full legal name is Quinton Michael Ashley.

I created Nostlan for fun and also to learn more about app development. Since Nostlan started as a personal project I wasn't under any pressure to make it look like a corporate website or follow any UI standards. Nostlan is an experiment in UI design. I consider it a piece of art that I'm sharing because I want other people to experience it too. Of course, I'd also like making some money off it but I have no interest in collecting your usage data, hijacking your cpu to mine crypto sh\*tcoin, or doing anything malicious.

I also put a LOT of effort into following the latest Electron security standards. All the 3rd party emulator cores that Nostlan uses are sandboxed, meaning they run in isolation from the main process.

Nostlan is open source software that does not infringe on any copyrights of publishers, developers, artists, or texture packers.
